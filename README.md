# Ask Manager

## About The Project

Ask Manager is an easy way of complying with the GDPR regarding cookie consent. Rather than trying to deceive users into thinking that they have to press "Accept all cookies" and consequently [getting a fine](https://web.archive.org/web/20220422103838/https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/21/23035289/google-reject-all-cookie-button-eu-privacy-data-laws), Ask Manager is built to follow EU laws regarding consent.
